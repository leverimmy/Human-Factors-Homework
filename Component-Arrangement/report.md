# Component Arrangement Homework

The improved design enhances usability by **grouping related controls**, **emphasizing critical components**, and **improving the visual and functional layout** for operational efficiency and safety.

### Issues in the Original Design:

1. **Bad Grouping**

   In the original design, buttons are grouped based on their shapes rather than their functions. This can confuse the operator, making it harder to identify and select the correct control during operation.

2. **Lack of Hierarchy**

   Critical controls, such as the **Emergency Stop**, are not visually prominent, reducing their accessibility and slowing response times in emergencies.

3. **Cluttered Layout**

   The layout is visually disorganized, with controls placed arbitrarily. This makes it difficult for operators to locate specific components quickly, increasing the likelihood of errors.

### Component Arrangement Principles in the Improved Design:

1. **Grouping by Functionality**:

   The improved design organizes components based on their functionalities, creating three clearly defined sections:

   - **Left Section**: Solvent-related controls (temperature, level, flow) are grouped together for logical operation.
   - **Center Section**: Crane controls (start, stop, direction, speed) are consolidated for ease of use.
   - **Right Section**: Coolant controls (pressure, flow) are grouped together.

2. **Importance Hierarchy**:

   The **Emergency Stop** is placed prominently in the center of the panel, ensuring it is highly visible and easily accessible in critical situations.

3. **Comfortability**:

   Controls are positioned to reduce confusion and enhance ease of use:

   - The **solvent flow switch** is located on the left.
   - The **coolant flow switch** is on the right.

   This symmetry aligns with the operatorâ€™s natural hand movements, reducing cognitive and physical strain.

4. **Sequential Arrangement**:

   Controls are arranged in the order of operation within functional groups, making the workflow intuitive.
