1. The independent variables, dependent variables, and their levels are as follows:

   **Independent Variables**

   - Task Performing Condition (TPC):
     - Levels: "Continuous" (no interruptions) and "Interrupted" (with social media interruptions).
   - Task Cognitive Level (TCL):
     - Levels: "Skill-based," "Rule-based," and "Knowledge-based" tasks.

   **Dependent Variables**

   - Perceived Mental Workload
     - Measured via NASA-TLX overall score.
   - Physiological Indexes:
     - ECG (Heart Rate [HR], LF/HF ratio, SDNN)
     - EDA (Skin Conductance [SC])
   - Primary Task Performance:
     - Response Time (RT) and Error Rate.
2. Task difficulty levels were defined using Rasmussenâ€™s cognitive taxonomy:
   - Skill-based tasks: Automatic, pattern-driven actions (e.g., visual tracking). Minimal cognitive effort, relying on stored motor patterns.
   - Rule-based tasks: Goal-oriented decisions using predefined rules (e.g., selecting the larger object). Moderate cognitive effort, requiring working memory for rule application.
   - Knowledge-based tasks: Complex problem-solving in unfamiliar scenarios (e.g., modifying a schedule). High cognitive effort, demanding active decision-making and planning.
